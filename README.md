In today's field of food science, the quality and safety of food products are of paramount importance. To ensure the quality of food, tools such as spectral analysis are often relied upon to decipher the composition and characteristics of food items. Spectral analysis is a technique that involves measuring the relative intensities of light at different wavelengths to obtain data. It can be used to analyze various types of food, ranging from agricultural products to beverages. We have developed a tool for food spectral analysis, with the core being a Python-based GUI application. This tool utilizes several Python libraries, including Tkinter, pandas, numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, and matplotlib, to create an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI). Users can load food spectral data, configure model parameters, and visualize analysis results.
